      <div>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for specifying the presentation and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[2]
      CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[3]
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, 
      colors, and fonts.</div>
